<h1>Description of Project</h1>
This is my assignment for OOP year 2018/2019.

I based it off the movie Alien: Covenant. It can be seen in the ship in some of the earlier scenes and is meant to be a part of the ship's navigation system.


<h1>Instructions</h1>
The interface operates quite easily. When it starts it will be rotating clockwise or stationary. The space bar will reset the shapes to the center and pressing the left or right arrow keys will trigger the shapes to move counter-clockwise or clockwise respectively.

<h1>How it Works</h1>
The interface works by utilizing the rotate() function from PApplet.

<h1>What I am Most Proud of in this Assignment</h1>
I am happy to have gotten succesful repeating shapes nested in one another with correct spacing between them and to have them rotate. Using the RIGHT and LEFT keys to control the rotation is a bonus too!
